Brian was woken up by a loud booming sound. He looked at his at phone to see that it was only two in the morning. He has only fallen asleep only half an hour earlier. He got out of his bed and walked over to his window. It was raining heavily and has been for the past two days. "Hopefully school gets cancelled from all the rain and flooding," he thought to himself. Without any further thought, Brian get back into his bed and hoped to fall asleep.
