Brian was woken up by a loud booming sound. He looked at his at phone to see that it was only two in the morning. He has only fallen asleep only half an hour earlier. He got out of his bed and walked over to his window. It was raining heavily and has been for the past two days. "Hopefully school gets cancelled from all the rain and flooding," he thought to himself. Without any further thought, Brian get back into his bed and hoped to fall asleep.

CRASH. After a few more peaceful minutes of sleep, Brian was once again
awakened. This sound seemed much closer than the last, so he hustled out of
bed to the window once more. Brian's heart nearly stopped. Outside, a squirrel
cowered in the rain. The little guy was illuminated by a green beam of light
coming from the sky, shining and pulsing like nothing Brian had ever seen. He
followed the light upwards with his eyes, and found himself staring straight 
at a UFO. 

The UFO descended towards the ground and Brian saw faces within the ship like 
nothing he'd seen before. The ship landed, and everything in the world seemed to
stop. A sudden pop, a hiss, and a ramp seemingly materialized from the hull of 
the vessel. The green light now filled the night, blinding Brian. With no warning, 
something suddenly grabbed his hand.
